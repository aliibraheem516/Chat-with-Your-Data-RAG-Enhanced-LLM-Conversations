# Chat-with-Your-Data-RAG-Enhanced-LLM-Conversations
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for interacting with the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. This project allows you to ask questions and get accurate, context-aware answers directly from the book's content using advanced natural language processing techniques.
